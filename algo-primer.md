# A Short Essay on the Growth of Functions

The application seeks to compute the big-*O* asymptotic complexity of an
arbitrary sorting algorithm. Given a randomized array of integers our application
reports the worst-case running time of that algorithm.

## Asymptotic Bounded

We are concerned mainly with the order of magnitude of the growth of an algorithm.
This is a simple metric of the efficiency of an algorithm. When computing
the asymptotic time complexity of an algorithm we only consider large enough
inputs to make only the order-of-magnitude of the running time
relevant. In other words, we consider inputs so large any multiplicative or
additive constants are deemed negligible.
